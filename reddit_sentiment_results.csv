My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,2054,178,1735511285.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hp7pim/my_data_science_manifesto_from_a_self_taught_data/,"**Background**

I’m a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. I’m more math minded than the average person, but I’m not special. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.


**Gatekeeping**

Every day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of “what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS?” The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone who’s been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I don’t think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.



As a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didn’t remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. 



When I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. I’d take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually I’d get defeated because I realized I couldn’t remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.


**What you actually need**

The reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.


For calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.



For stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.



For linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.



For probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.



You don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.



You don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.



Of all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. 



By far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to ""frame"" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like ""should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?"" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, ""I don't know, try it, measure it, and see"". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   



Despite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.



The reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  



Good domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. 


**Advice for those self taught**


I’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.



I taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.


The first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. 



My boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. 

  

Eventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. 



Once I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.



After 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.



I'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.


**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.

**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.


I thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.

**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic","My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist **Background**

It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.


**What you actually need**

The reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.


For calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.



For stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.



For linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.



For probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.



You don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.



You don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.



Of all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. 



By far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to ""frame"" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like ""should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?"" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, ""I don't know, try it, measure it, and see"". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   



Despite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.



The reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  



Good domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. 


**Advice for those self taught**


I’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.



I taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.


The first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. 



My boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. 

  

Eventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. 



Once I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.



After 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.



I'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.


**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.

**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.


I thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.

**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",my data science manifesto from a self taught data scientist background im a selftaught data scientist with about years of data analyst experience and now about years as a data scientist im more math minded than the average person but im not special i have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and have worked alongside data scientists of which have phds and the other have a masters despite being probably the th out of in natural ability i have been the nd most productive data scientist out of the group gatekeeping every day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of what do i need to know to get started in mlds the answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master as someone whos been on both sides this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry i dont think you can be bad at math and have no prerequisite knowledge and be successful but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity as a mechanical engineering student i had at least calculus courses a linear algebra course and a probability course but it was years before i attempted to become a ds and i didnt remember much at all this sub and others like it made me think i had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to

That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,1811,148,1646856194.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/tag8l5/my_guide_to_writing_a_killer_cover_letter/,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isn’t true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and you’ll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and you’ll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Here’s the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What you’ll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the “what you’ll do” portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that they’re addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3a2be51ee0c9d009f81068868ee28064271904

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you don’t. We also want to highlight the ‘preferred’ or ‘nice-to-have’ items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think you’re almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&s=282abefe6281837a26d748131dbb9aca1daba54d

Make sure to note all these skills you’ve highlighted in the job description down. We’re now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Here’s an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=76992f4e46b66a259504c8fb0bcc2f1ec6fca3ab

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you don’t need qualifications for all the requirements. We’re only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects they’ve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employer’s language. So if a job description mentions “QuickBooks,” don’t just say you’ve used “accounting software”.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

You’re a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the company’s mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* What’s the product?
* What’s unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organization’s community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the company’s blog.

Once you’ve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if you’ve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. It’s not mandatory and it’s not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

We’re going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c769a4c46e74c14d1b52b995177237b3569ba76

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edfa8b0ec98b32708cca1db7b2c56c1b46b6fde5

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences you’re about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, I’ve helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now I’m excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=09585eef6003225bfc97c0cd38d5dc122af93b0a

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

We’re going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=da38789ff4180a422a237027d1dd4827993f1dca

And let’s take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Let’s figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8057bf24031ebb66a10d21aac45f5f5836bf6ed8

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d242ebd6f3764b64ce49d530a8a22df03ddfad97

So what we’ve done here is abstracted some themes from this person’s actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7003513dacbe9704ed3a8b8c430f1932d4d0706a

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=663d5c64f7cc9d4e63fcd37fdf0bda1358ebbdfc

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that you’ve got two reasons, it’s time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, I’ve been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the company’s values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you can’t really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why you’re actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think you’ll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, here’s what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&s=60072e121835415cbfa0f3706c91ad2faad5b1bf

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

here is abstracted some themes from this persons actual qualifications i know this isnt super scientific more themes than just one work for most qualifications but the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell and now that you have your theme you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format some more examples vi why do you want to work there pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research i like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related if you use their product though that should be first on your list if you want to check out some examples for this you can do that here here and here now that youve got two reasons its time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together third ive been following company for a couple of months now and i resonate with both the companys values and its general direction the insert value really stands out to me because insert reason i also recently read that insert topical reason and this appeals to me because why it appeals to you realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company and if you cant really think of anything maybe you need to rethink why youre actually applying vi conclusion simply state what you want and why you want it i think youll find that my experience is a really good fit for company and specifically this position im ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back thanks your name putting it together combing everything heres what my cover letter for my current job looked like and voila you now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter credit thanks for reading theres great information available on this topic

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

Here are the questions I was asked for my entry level DS job!,1573,254,1662909364.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xbl58o/here_are_the_questions_i_was_asked_for_my_entry/,"Hey everyone. I posted a thread a few days ago about being nervous about my first DS interview. The thread was taken down by mods due to it being more appropriate for the stickied thread. So I want to make this thread less about questions, but more of an informative post to show you some of the questions I was asked. Hopefully it's helpful for newbies and veterans alike!

&#x200B;

**SQL:**

* What is a view?
* Is a table dynamic or static?
* Difference between a primary key and foreign key
* Inner Join vs. Left Join scenario (pretty sure it was from w3schools. ez pz)
* WHERE vs. HAVING
* When would you use a subquery? Provide an example
* How would you improve the performance of a slow query?
* EDIT: Some aggregation and GROUP by questions (MAX, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that I just remembered.

**Python**

* Explanation of libraries I use (Pandas mainly)
* How would you get the maximum result from a list?
* Can you explain the concept of functions
* Difference between FOR and WHILE loops?
* Give some examples of how you would clean dirty data.

**Tableau:**

* What is a calculated field? Provide some examples in your work
* What is the difference between a live view and extract? When would you use each?
* More information given on the data I work with

**Statistics:**

* Explain what a p-value is to someone who has no idea what that is.
* Explanation on linear/logistic regression modeling.
* What is standard deviation? Examples?
* Difference between STDEV and Variance?
* What statistics do you currently work with? (Descriptive mainly... mean, median, mode, stdev, confidence intervals)

I advanced to round 3 immediately, which is pretty much a shoe-in according to the hiring manager. I am very excited because it seems like a great opportunity. Even if I don't get it, I still felt like I interviewed very well and did my best. I am very proud of myself.

120k a year w/ benefits, bonuses, and training courses a week to help me learn more advanced DS concepts, Python, or whatever I want. I am so excited.","Here are the questions I was asked for my entry level DS job! Hey everyone. I posted a thread a few days ago about being nervous about my first DS interview.

"A ""Data Science"" company stole my gf's ML project and reposted it as their own. What do I do?",1492,75,1589721968.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/glfdmm/a_data_science_company_stole_my_gfs_ml_project/,"Dean Hoffman responds: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gmirks/my\_apologies\_from\_a\_data\_science\_company\_stole\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gmirks/my_apologies_from_a_data_science_company_stole_my/)

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

I’m sick of it. I hope each one of yall cause a data leak, breach the confidentiality by voluntarily giving private info to Gemini/OpenAi and finally create immense tech debt by developing your vibe coded projects.

They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon. But mastering the science aspect of data science is I believe the best way to make yourself extremely valuable.","The Key Word in Data Science is Science, not Data I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub.

You might remember me from the Data Science Cheatsheet I posted a few months ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ljftgi/i_created_a_fourpage_data_science_cheatsheet_to/)). The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!
